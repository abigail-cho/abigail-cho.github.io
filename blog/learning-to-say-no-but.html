I&#x27;m going to be writing about anything for my <strong>first ever blog post</strong>, it might as well be about one of best lessons I&#x27;ve learned (so far!): learning to say &quot;No, <strong>but</strong>...&quot; (not to be confused with its closely related precursor, &quot;No&quot;).</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="say-yes-to-impress">Say yes to impress!<a href="#say-yes-to-impress" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Say yes to impress!" title="Direct link to Say yes to impress!">​</a></h2>
<p>I think everyone that starts out is eager to please. They want to stun! They want to dazzle! They want to amaze! For tech writers, I think this is even more amplified because we are acutely aware that some (okay, most) people aren&#x27;t crazy about documenting things. Documentation is often times considered an afterthought or tedious chore to be done after the flashy product release. So, we want to prove that we <strong>are</strong>, in fact, a useful and important function in the company. And while I think the general attitude around docs definitely has opportunity to change, I generally believe that having the drive to prove value isn&#x27;t inherently wrong. Doing your best should be a given.</p>
<p>But early on, I confused &quot;my best&quot; with &quot;more work&quot;.</p>
<p>Indeed, I thought that if I wasn&#x27;t buried in tasks day in and day out, then it meant that I had more of my best to give. That every assignment, no matter the importance or size, needed to be urgently prioritized. That every request, no matter how lofty or unattainable, had to be met with a resounding and enthusiastic &quot;Yes!&quot;</p>
<p>I get exhausted just remembering it, so you can imagine how well it went at the time. Of course, that strategy didn&#x27;t last very long, because once I started tackling the asks that I had no business accepting in the first place, I started running into serious roadblocks. And after I cleared those, I dropped into a rabbit hole of questions. And once I dug my way out of those, I found myself performing archaeological investigations trying to figure out why the heck we put a doc about &quot;sushi&quot; under a category about &quot;sandwiches&quot;—because surely there&#x27;s a good reason for this, right? Right??</p>
<p>And then regret set in, because I could tell that I was wasting my time on a task that took a lot of effort but didn&#x27;t have a worthwhile gain. But I couldn&#x27;t just back out of something I said I&#x27;d do at this point, because other colleagues had deadlines and plans depending on me. So my only choice was to finish what I had and then make sure this <strong>never</strong> happened again.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="say-no-say-no-to-everything">Say no. Say no to <em><strong>everything.</strong></em><a href="#say-no-say-no-to-everything" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to say-no-say-no-to-everything" title="Direct link to say-no-say-no-to-everything">​</a></h2>
<p>Okay, not <strong>everything</strong> everything. I was still waking up with the intention to work. But I was notably more wary than I was before. This was also when I started my first position as a lone (and founding) technical writer at an organization, so I <strong>really</strong> had my guard up. Just from the first week, I could tell I&#x27;d need to say no <strong>a lot.</strong></p>
<p>And to be honest, I think my philosophy about it was usually fair. I had a lot of larger efforts going to get technical writing off the ground, and I also had some tasks that I really couldn&#x27;t say no to as well—like new product documentation, for example. And some requests I got, I actually had a good reason for saying no to—like, for example, a request to write a doc explaining why the user shouldn&#x27;t trust some unintuitive status colors and instead use that article. The article in question would say something completely different from expectations in the product, and essentially told users that they couldn&#x27;t trust the product to deliver a good experience. I certainly wasn&#x27;t going to immortalize that in writing on our knowledge base, so I diagnosed that one as a product problem rather than a docs problem and promptly rejected it.</p>
<p>The problem with that was: I didn&#x27;t say any of that reasoning. Or any reasoning for most of things I rejected. I just said &quot;Sorry, no&quot; or &quot;Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t commit to that right now&quot; and was done with it.</p>
<p>I thought I was doing the right thing: I was streamlining my workload so I could focus on the tasks that I believed would have the highest impact for the business.  But I just ended up putting blinders on myself. Rejecting people outright meant that there couldn&#x27;t be further discussion, which meant small problems that might&#x27;ve been low priority in isolation could&#x27;ve been symptoms of larger problems that I had not realized (and often were). Rejection also didn&#x27;t make the problem go away—it would just sit until someone ran into the same thing again, ask around to see why that problem was there, hear that the tech writing team (me) rejected it for some reason (none given), and then just submit it to me all over again.</p>
<p>Most importantly, however, I realized that without explanation, peoples&#x27; <strong>habits</strong> wouldn&#x27;t change. I actually had technical writing reasons for rejecting most requests, but when I wasn&#x27;t conveying that to others, they would just keep asking the same types of questions. And my true goal as the lone tech writer was to get <strong>everyone</strong> thinking about documentation best practices—because I wasn&#x27;t able to do it alone, and that is ultimately the best way to demonstrate <strong>value</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="say-nobut-actually">Say no...but actually<a href="#say-nobut-actually" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Say no...but actually" title="Direct link to Say no...but actually">​</a></h2>
<p>One day, a colleague from product marketing approached me asking if we could put an FAQ on the docs site. I&#x27;m personally a bit wary of articles solely as FAQs, but I wanted to hear her out and start applying my new philosophy: don&#x27;t just reject, but change minds and provide alternate solutions.</p>
<p>It turned out what she wanted was an FAQ about compliance and security information for the latest integration we were releasing. This integration needed a lot of access to the user&#x27;s system to work, and would obviously raise a lot of security concerns. However, it was clear to me that, based on the content that she already put together so far, this was almost certainly going to need to be a carefully constructed legal document rather than an informative article. Words were my thing, but legal certainly wasn&#x27;t, and I wasn&#x27;t comfortable having such delicate content on the knowledge base, which the legal team didn&#x27;t interact with at the time.</p>
<p>So I told her &quot;No&quot;. Cue the slight look of disappointment.</p>
<p>Then, I said, &quot;But...&quot;</p>
<p>I continued on to say that it definitely sounded like a document that <strong>needed</strong> to exist, but probably didn&#x27;t belong in the knowledge base—for the reasons above. So goal number one accomplished: help others understand technical writing values, like what kind of subjects do and don&#x27;t go in a help center.</p>
<p>Then, I told her that I&#x27;d worked with our legal and security teams before for another similar project in the past, and they ended up putting that content on the website alongside some of our other compliance documents. I was sure they&#x27;d be happy to work with her on this as well. I also offered to help copyedit what she had so far, although obviously the final say on language would have to be from legal. So goal number two: provide an alternative solution.</p>
<p>And, what do you know it, she was really responsive to this answer. She nodded along and said that, after thinking about it, she agreed it made the most sense to keep all the compliance docs together on the website. She also said that my offer to help was appreciated, but not necessary, since the legal team would have their own way revising this type of document. Then, with smiles, we went our separate ways.</p>
<p>So, to sum it up, here&#x27;s what I achieved with the &quot;No, but...&quot; strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>My colleague gained new understanding on how to think about categorizing content</li>
<li>She  came away with an alternative solution that gave her a path forward rather than going back empty-handed</li>
<li>She felt acknowledged and supported that her idea was valuable even though I wasn&#x27;t necessarily the right person to ask</li>
<li>And I ended up not having to do any work related to this anyway, which was my original goal when I was just saying &quot;No&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="afterword">Afterword<a href="#afterword" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Afterword" title="Direct link to Afterword">​</a></h2>
<p>Not all of my &quot;No, but...&quot; conversations went exactly like it did with my colleague. Not that I had bad experiences—I&#x27;m fortunate enough to say that I&#x27;ve gotten along with almost everyone I&#x27;ve worked with—but I wasn&#x27;t able to get the same feedback as I did with that one-on-one conversation. A lot of requests or one-off questions came to me through Slack, for example, and while I still stuck to my &quot;No, but&quot; philosophy, it was hard to tell if my explanations were landing with people.</p>
<p>I think what really solidified that it <strong>was</strong> truly working was when my manager came to me one day and said, &quot;So I noticed this was happening.&quot; And more than that, they shared that they were having conversations with other employees about documentation, and they brought up some of the conversations they had with me and how they used it in their thought processes. They congratulated me on my new behavior, and reiterated what I already believed: that having this strategy of providing explanation after rejection helped others gain <strong>understanding</strong>. This makes teammates feel heard and validated with their concerns while reducing the time wasted on extraneous requests or meetings—basically, makes the business run better.</p>
<p>I was also noting a pattern: colleagues were sending me fewer repeat requests, and I engaged in a lot more conversations about documentation practices instead. More people also started going to the right teams I routed them to rather than coming to me by default for all word-related things.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that I ended up spending less time denying irrelevant requests and more time focusing on actual docs tasks—and I got to teach some people about documentation too. Not that I expected them to become experts, but it was nice to share knowledge and shed some light on a field that is sometimes looked over as an afterthought at companies. And it shouldn&#x27;t be overlooked that it also made my colleagues feel better and more comfortable about asking questions.</p>
<p>So, if you&#x27;ve found yourself in a situation similar to mine and you&#x27;ve found that &quot;No&quot; is not enough, then might I suggest a bit of &quot;No, but&quot;?</p></div><footer class="docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm theme-blog-footer-edit-meta-row"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Content related to my professional life" class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/professional">professional</a></li></ul></div></div></footer></article></main><div class="col col--2"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#say-yes-to-impress" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Say yes to impress!</a></li><li><a href="#say-no-say-no-to-everything" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Say no.
